# Ostad_assignment_firebase

A Flutter project for the Ostad Firebase Assignment that demonstrates fetching and displaying data from Firebase Firestore.  

## Assignment Description
This app demonstrates a simple data fetching operation from a Firebase Firestore database. The main goal is to display a list of football matches that are manually added to Firestore. When a user taps on a specific match, the app navigates to a new screen to display its detailed information, including scores and time, by retrieving the data from the database.
